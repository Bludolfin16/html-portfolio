<h1>The Best Anime According to Blu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime for now.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite anime. A person can grow up with long running anime like this.</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>This is an awesome take on what most would call a "monster".</p>
<h3>Campfire cooking in another world</h3>
<p>This is an isekai anime, where the MC dies and gets a new life in another world. I think this is one of the cuter ones out there.</p>
